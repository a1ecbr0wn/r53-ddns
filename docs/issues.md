# Issues

If you are having issues with the execution of this application, start by enabling verbose logging with the `-v` parameter.  If you are trying to resolve an issue while running this in cron or as a service, logging is enabled by default to the file `/var/tmp/r53-ddns.log` which is a file that should be writable whichever user you are sunning the application under.

If the issues are not obvious or you think there is a bug, please raise an issue via [GitHub](https://github.com/a1ecbr0wn/homebrew-r53-ddns/issues).
